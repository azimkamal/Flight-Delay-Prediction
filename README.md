# Flight-Delay-Prediction
This is my first Data Science Project. It consist of my approach in Predicting Flight Delay using Machine Learning Model. This project includes Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Modeling and Model Evaluation. 

In this project, I used a historical data, which contains information from over 500,000 domestic flights on January 2018 in the United States. The dataset can be retrieved from https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time
